Thanks for downloading this pack,
I don't actually know how to change other mods' icons so the installation is a bit different, In this case, you need to change the mod itself

Scatterer:

For scatterer, go to Gamedata/scatterer/icon and replace the image with the one in ModIcons/scatterer

EVE:

For EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements, go to Gamedata/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements, and replace button.png with the button.png in ModIcons/EVE

Planetshine:

For Planetshine, go to Gamedata/PlanetShine/Icons and drag the three images from ModIcons/PS over there, when prompted, click replace

DistantObjectEnhancements:

For DOE, go to Gamedata/DistantObject/Icons and drag the four images from ModIcons/DOE over, when prompted, click replace
