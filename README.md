Ksp visual mod icon overhaul

I was a bit tired of having to deal with the suboptimal icons that come with a few visual mods, so I made a reddit post to get some icons in, after tweaking them to make it work, I decided to share the tweaked icons, credits for the original icons goes to reddit user u/Jumata, The recompiling and glow effects are made by me (u/Strike_3-0), I only tweaked the visual mods (I also added planetshine, and all the new textures on release 2.0), so for some other mods, the original thread is at https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/pcgsun/small_pixel_art_competition/.
